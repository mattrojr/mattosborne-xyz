                    World Builder is a site built to help Game Masters prepare and run tabletop role playing games. It's currently
                    in a very early stage of development, but feel free to make an account and check out its current functionality.
                    At the moment, I believe World Builder provides an intuitive way of building and navigating the areas your players
                    will be exploring during your campaigns, allowing you to focus more on running a town full of NPCs and less on searching
                    through the pages of a PDF or adventure book to find the description of the contents of the mayor's linen closet.
                    <b>Fair warning</b>, while I'll be making every effort to preserve user created content going forward, I can't
                    guarantee that said content won't fall victim to a radical design change or any bumps in the development process.
                    Methods to import and export content are on the agenda but are not currently implemented, so please don't keep your
                    only copy of the campaign that's going to rocket you to TTRPG stardom on here.
